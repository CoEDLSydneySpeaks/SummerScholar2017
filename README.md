# SummerScholar2017

### Purpose

This repository stores the results from the CoEDL Summer Scholar Program:

* [Developing tools for analysis and visualisation](http://www.dynamicsoflanguage.edu.au/get-involved/vacancies/summer-scholars-program/) - Summer Scholar Projects Link

The aim of this project was to develop tools for quantitative analysis and visualisation of linguistic data. These tools facilitate and accelerate time-consuming processes required for the study of linguistic variation, and secondly they are accessible to researchers who don’t have sufficient knowledge of computational linguistics to conduct the necessary analyses.

Supervisor: Simón González (as part of the Sydney Speaks project, led by Catherine Travis, and the Transcription Acceleration Project)
